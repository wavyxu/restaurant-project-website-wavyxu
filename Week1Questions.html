        <p id="HTMLQuestionAns"><strong>Answer: </strong>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed
        in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page title, links to CSS,
        links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document)</p>
