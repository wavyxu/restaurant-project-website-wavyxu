# Student Static Restaurant Website Project

This *README* file will be something that you will eventually use to communicate with the teacher and grader. For now I'm just including the project and assignment rough draft information.

# Project: Hand Crafted Website

This project will be under taken over multiple weeks with a portion of the project to be turned in every week along with a small homework set on the material covered during the week.

## Fictitious Restaurant Website

A website can be one of the most cost effective forms of advertising for a small business such as a restaurant. For this project you will need to invent your own restaurant.

You will need to invent basic information such as:

* The Restaurant's name
* Location
* Open Hours
* Menu

To give us more content, to later style, create the **menu** with at least four categories of items. Some categories that you might think of using:

* Appetizers
* Main courses
* Soups
* Salads
* Naan (different types)
* Curries
* Meat
* Fish
* Vegetarian
* Other food types if your restaurant offers multiples, e.g., pizza, pasta
* Deserts
* Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner

Come up with 3 to 10 items for each category. This is your restaurant so you can put whatever you like on the menu.  You **cannot** copy a menu from an existing restaurant. This is an **individual assignment** so every students restaurant must be unique.

## Project Plan

Over the next few weeks we plan on creating and adding
1. Basic HTML content with modern HTML5 semantic structuring (not just a bunch of `<div>` elements!)
1. Hand crafted CSS for styling
2. Images of Location and/or restaurant interior -- any non-copyright image is okay as long as you cite the source.
3. Images of some of the food items
4. Mobile friendly styling
5. Handcrafted CSS and CSS Framework (Bootstrap, Semantic-UI, Foundation) to the site.

Details of the requirements in addition to the above will be given out with the weekly assignments.  You will use the same repository for the entire project. We will give you *branch* names if we want you to branch and *tag* names for *releases* when turning in the assignment.
